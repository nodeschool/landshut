<p>We, the organizers of <strong>Nodeschool Landshut</strong>, are dedicated to providing a
harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body
size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers
of <strong>Nodeschool Landshut</strong>.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender
identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
for any events at <strong>Nodeschool Landshut</strong> meetups or in any related
communication channels. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior
are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to
the anti-harassment policy.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of
<strong>Nodeschool Landshut</strong> may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being
harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns,
please contact an organizer immediately.</p>

<p>The organizers of the above communities developed this Code of Conduct to
govern their respective events and communication channels. We used <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/Code_of_Conduct/">PDX
Pythonâ€™s anti-harassment policy</a>
and the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy</a>
as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its inspirations, is licensed under
